# javascript and classes
- Js is a prototype based language which just gives the syntactic sugar of classes which makes us feel like we are using classes 

## OOP

## Object 
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase, toUpperCase, Date, Promises

## why use OOP
- code messup (no chunk reused) /// services can be used and many more 

## parts of OOP
Object literal (it means literal on for eg: if i say i literally mean two its like that)

- Constructor Function
- Prototypes
- classes
- Instance(new,this)

## keep in mind the 4 pillars also
